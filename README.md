### **What does "*Ratio*" mean on Twitter?**
- A *ratio* happens when a user gets more likes on their tweet than the tweet they are replying to 
- Ratio's are commonly used to display a dislike of a tweet
- If a user says *'ratio'* and they receive more likes than the tweet they are replying to, then they *"won"* the attempted ratio
- The person with the least amount of likes is usually the person that people tend to disagree with
- A ratio is very popular and common on Twitter

### **How the bot is used**
- ***Users must be following the bot Twitter page for the bot to work***
- There are two ways of interacting with the bot: 
    1. Tag the bot **(@ratiocheck)** when replying to someone's tweet
        - When used this way, the bot will scan through the profile of the tweet being replied to and check for all their attempted ratio's and reply to the user that tagged **@ratiocheck** with the stats of the user's ratio attempts
    2. Post a tweet tagging **@ratiocheck** along with the hashtag **#MyRatioStats**
        - When used this way, the bot will scan the user's account for all attempted ratio's and DM (direct message) the user with their attempted ratio's, successful ratio's, and the strength of their ratio's *(the higher the attempts and the highter their success, the higher their strength)*

### **What does this bot do?**
- When a user tags the bot **(@ratiocheck)** when replying to someone else's tweet, the bot will scan through all tweets of the user being replied to
- The bot will tweet when their is a new ***"King of ratio's"*** (based on attempts, success, and strength of ratio's overall) found and pin the tweet on the **@ratiocheck** profile

### **Why?**
- Because it's a fun and different project.
