### **What does "*Ratio*" mean on Twitter?**
- A *ratio* happens when a users reply to a tweet or comment gets more likes than the tweet they are replying to 
- Ratio's are commonly used to measure the disapproval or unpopularity of someone's tweet 
- If a user replies to a tweet or comment with *"ratio"* **and** they receive more likes than the tweet they are replying to, then they were successful at *"ratio-ing"* another twitter user and displaying the unpopularity of that tweet
- The person with the least amount of likes is usually the person that people tend to disagree with
- A ratio is very popular and common on Twitter

### **What does this bot do?**
- The bot scans through the entire history of a users tweets and gathers up all information relating to **ratio** attempts and displays that specific users statistics and succcess rate when it comes to attempting to **ratio** users on twitter.

### **How the bot is used**
- ***Users must be following the bot Twitter page for the bot to work***
- There are two ways of interacting with the bot: 
    1. Tag the bot **(@ratiocheck)** when replying to someone's tweet
        - When used this way, the bot will scan through the profile of the tweet being replied to and check for all their attempted ratio's and reply to the user that tagged **@ratiocheck** with the stats of the user's ratio attempts
    2. Post a tweet tagging **@ratiocheck** along with the hashtag **#MyRatioStats**
        - When used this way, the bot will scan the user's account for all attempted ratio's and DM (direct message) the user with their attempted ratio's, successful ratio's, and the strength of their ratio's *(the higher the attempts and the highter their success, the higher their strength)*


### **Why the heck did you build this?**
- Simple. Because it was fun and felt like a different project.
